# KUDO manifests

These files are generated by `make generate-manifests` using `kudo init` output to keep in sync with kudo.
These files can be used as example files of prerequisites to the cluster for a kudo environment, however the `kudo-manager-instance-admission-webhook-config.yaml` file in particular has been modified to support development.

**NOTE:** These files are mainly here to support quick and easy development and debugging of kudo on a local machine.
