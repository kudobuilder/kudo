Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator (KUDO) provides a declarative approach to building production-grade Kubernetes Operators covering the entire application lifecycle.

## Getting Started

See the [Documentation](docs) with [Examples](config/samples).

![Quick Start](docs/images/quickstart-0.1.0.gif)

## Pre-requisites

Before you get started:

- Install Go `1.11` or later
- Latest version of `dep`
- Kubernetes Cluster `1.12` or later (e.g. [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/))
- [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) with version `1.12` or later

## Installation Instructions

- Get KUDO repo: `go get github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/`
- `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/kudobuilder/kudo`
- `make install` to deploy universal CRDs
- `make run` to run the Operator with local go environment

**Notes:**
1. If `go get ...` is not functioning, an alternative is to:
  * `cd $GOPATH`
  * `mkdir -p src/github.com/kudobuilder`
  * `cd src/github.com/kudobuilder`
  * `git clone git@github.com:kudobuilder/kudo.git`
2. **Before** `make install` you will need to have:
  * minikube running (some of the tests run against it)
  * `~/.git-credentials` must exist with git credentials. If you are using two-factor auth you will need a create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
  * `lint` in $PATH which is provided by having `$GOPATH\bin` in `$PATH` as in `export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH`.

## Concepts
- *Framework*: High-level description of a deployable application (e.g., Apache Kafka)
- *FrameworkVersion*: Specific version of a deployable application, including lifecycle hooks for deployments, upgrades, and rollbacks (e.g., Kafka version 2.4.1)
- *Instance*: Resource created to manage an instance of specific FrameworkVersion. Instances are pets and have the same name throughout its entire lifecycle. (e.g., Kafka 2.4.1 cluster with 3 brokers)
- *PlanExecution*: Kudo-managed resource defining the inputs and status of an instanceâ€™s executable plans (e.g., upgrade kafka from version 2.4.1 -> 2.4.2)

## Deploy your first Application

Create a `Framework` object for Zookeeper
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kudobuilder/frameworks/master/repo/stable/zookeeper/versions/0/zookeeper-framework.yaml
framework.kudo.k8s.io/zookeeper created
```

Create a `FrameworkVersion` for the Zookeeper  `Framework`

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kudobuilder/frameworks/master/repo/stable/zookeeper/versions/0/zookeeper-frameworkversion.yaml
frameworkversion.kudo.k8s.io/zookeeper-1.0 created
```


Create an Instance of the Zookeeper
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kudobuilder/frameworks/master/repo/stable/zookeeper/versions/0/zookeeper-instance.yaml
instance.kudo.k8s.io/zk created
```

When an instance is created, the default `deploy` plan is executed.

```
$ kubectl get planexecutions
NAME                  AGE
zk-deploy-317743000   53s
```

The statefulset defined in the `FrameworkVersion` comes up with 3 pods:

```bash
kubectl get statefulset zk-zk
NAME    DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE
zk-zk   3         3         1m20s
```

```bash
 kubectl get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
zk-zk-0                 1/1     Running            0          23s
zk-zk-1                 1/1     Running            0          23s
zk-zk-2                 1/1     Running            0          23s
```
