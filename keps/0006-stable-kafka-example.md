## Summary

In order to get KUDO ready for production it's useful to pick a specific workload, make it stable, and drive the KUDO roadmap from its requirements. Apache Kafka is a good candidate for the following reasons:

* it's one of the most popular stateful distributed systems
* its operator tasks are similar to many other stateful systems
* an example already exists in the KUDO repository

## Motivation

A team-sponsored production ready framework using KUDO helps with prioritizing features needed to achieve this goal.

## Proposal

TBD. For example:
Here are some features and things we should be able to do to consider Kafka production ready.

* Deploy single broker and multiple broker configurations
* Vertically scale brokers
* Update from one version to another

### Goals

* Define criteria for what is considered a stable KUDO framework
* Identify features required for a stable Kafka and Zookeeper framework, create KEPs for them
* Create a stable Kafka framework
* Create a stable Zookeeper framework

### Non-Goals

* Any new KUDO features will not be covered by this KEP
