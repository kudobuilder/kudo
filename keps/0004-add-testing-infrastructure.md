## Summary

As the complexity and scope of KUDO grows, it becomes impossible to manually validate
exisiting frameworks and capabilities still function as expected. As part of a robust
CICD pipeline, a testing suite needs to be developed that can validate each commit, pull
request, or even deployment of KUDO on a cluster.

These testing packages should also assure conformance for the `kudobuilder/frameworks` repository
to particular versions of KUDO.

## Motivation

### Goals

- Ensure validation of API objects is functioning correctly
- Ensure controllers execute known process flows correctly
- Validate Framework and FrameworkVersions in kudobuilder/frameworks adhere to the API spec defined by Kudo. Provide common
  misconfigurations and validate that the testing framework notifies the users/developer of failure
- Reduce review time for code changes by not requiring reviewers to validate functionality of test cases
- Reduce developer time for code changes by providing tools to validate functionality
- Provide developers clear tooling for addition additional tests to infrastructure to validate bug fixes and new features

### Non-Goals

- 100% Test coverage

## Proposal

This is a two phase proposal.

### Tests

Add testing packages to:

- pkg/apis - Conformance of objects, serialization, validation
- pkg/controller - Controllers implement the correct process flows for changes in Instance objects, and creation of PlanExecutions
- pkg/util - Util functions behave as expected

Integration tests

- Identify and build a common set of Frameworks and FrameworkVersions that can demonstrate/validate that functionality of the controller
  exists in real world situations.

### CICD

Use [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/) and the [GitHub Plugin](https://github.com/marketplace/circleci/plan/MDIyOk1hcmtldHBsYWNlTGlzdGluZ1BsYW45MA==#pricing-and-setup).
For OpenSource projects we will recieve 1,000 monthly build minutes. With the test suite below, that should suffice as a baseline.

#### Pull Requests

All Pull Requests into master need to have the following checks pass. These should be ordered in fastest to slowest to reduce the time spent when/if failures occur

0. Check author has signed CLA
1. `go fmt` does not change anything
1. `go lint` and `go vet` both pass
1. All unit tests pass (with `-race` flag)
1. Dockerfile builds (this requires all dependencies in the vendor folder)

Perform the same set of tests after merging master into the branch.

#### Master Branch

##### Pushes

Once merged into master a build process occurs to deploy the latest image at `kudobuilder/controller:latest`

##### Schedule

Running the build nightly/frequently will increase the chance of finding flaky tests.

##### Base Image Change

Since we don't have any tests that validate the image works (no integration tests) this seems uneccessary.

#### Tags/Release

- Build process occurs to deploy the image at `kudobuilder/controller:latest`.
- Create the YAML to deploy Kudo, and package up to store in GitHub Release

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a developer, I want to ensure my changes don't break existing functionality, even if I don't understand all the capabilities
of Kudo.

#### Story 2

As a repository owner, I don't want to have to validate the execution of common plans/functionality as part of the review process.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]

- Are new tests required for all (code) PRs? If fixing a bug, it's re-assuring if you can provide a test that demonstrates it not working,
  but the level of effort is significantly increased to push code. This might be counter productive in trying to encourage
  developers from contributing.
- Being able to run the "Test Frameworks" on a running cluster might provide value (e.g. sonobouy), but requires a maturation
  of that capability and might not be worth the effort

### Risks and Mitigations

- Complexity of a test and CICD system
- Overlooking edge cases and assuming they're still working when tests pass

## Graduation Criteria

How will we know that this has succeeded?

- When repository owners can feel confident that code changes are not breaking functionality.
- Tests pass for the API objects
- Leverage testing scaffolding provided by (and subsequently removed by us) Kubebuilder for
  controller logic.

## Implementation History

- Proposal KEP - 2019/02/18

## Infrastructure Needed [optional]

This depends on the particular tooling used:

Prow

- Kubernetes Cluster
- Manhours for Running Prow

CircleCI/TravisCI/GoogleCloudBuild

- Free baseline. Paid if we get more usage.
