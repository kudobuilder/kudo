## Summary

Drive KUDO to have a set of tools and specifications for creating operators.

## Motivation

KUDO provides a way to reduce the amount of code necessary for the creation of a operator for Kubernetes. The current implementation of KUDO requires a significant amount of YAML to define a operator, located in one file. This YAML relies in nested YAML inlined via multiline strings, is not extensible, and is prone to error. This KEP defines a operator SDK that solves these issues.

## Goals

The toolkit must provide the ability for:

- conditional inclusions
- defining default values
- replacement of values
- removal of keys and values

## Proposal

A KUDO operator is split into several base components, ordered from the outside-in:

- [Plans](#plans)
- [Steps](#steps)
- [Tasks](#tasks)
- [Templates](#templates)
- [Parameters](#parameters)
- [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases)
- [Execution State](#execution-state)

These combine to form a operator responsible for the deployment, upgrading, and day 2 operations of software deployed on Kubernetes. While KUDO ships with a templating system, it is not intended to advance the state of deploying software on Kubernetes, and provides facilities for integrating with other templating and deployment systems. KUDO's focus is instead on the sequencing and day 2 operations of this software, and is able to take advantage of existing templating to fulfill this need.

### Definitions

### Operator Organization

A operator bundle is a folder that contains all of the manifests needed to create or extend a KUDO operator. In the most basic form, a operator bundle is structured in the following format:

```shell
.
├── operator.yaml
├── params.yaml
└── common
    └── common.yaml
└── templates
    ├── backup.yaml
    ├── clear-data.yaml
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── init.yaml
    ├── load-data.yaml
    ├── pvc.yaml
    ├── restore.yaml
    └── service.yaml
```

#### operator.yaml

`operator.yaml` is the base definition of a operator. It follows the following format, extracted from the MySQL example:

```yaml
name: operator
description: operator
version: "5.7"
kudoVersion: ">= 0.2.0"
kubeVersion: ">= 1.14"
maintainers:
  - Bob <bob@example.com>
  - Alice <alice@example.com>
url: https://github.com/myoperator/myoperator
tasks:
  deploy:
    resources:
      - pvc.yaml
      - deployment.yaml
      - service.yaml
      - deployment2.yaml
      - job.yaml
    patches:
      - deploy-patch.yaml
    patchesStrategicMerge:
      - super-weird-deploy-patch.yaml
  init:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
  pv:
    resources:
      - pvc.yaml
  backup:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - backup.yaml
  restore:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - restore.yaml
  load-data:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - load-data.yaml
  clear-data:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - clear-data.yaml
  query:
    resources:
      - job.yaml
plans:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: deploy
        tasks:
          - deploy
      - name: init
        tasks:
          - init
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - init
        delete: true
  backup:
    steps:
      - name: pv
        tasks:
          - pv
      - name: backup
        tasks:
          - backup
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - backup
        delete: true
  restore:
    steps:
      - name: restore
        tasks:
          - restore
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - restore
        delete: true
```

While subsequent sections go into deeper detail, the top level keys of the operator are:

- **version**: String defining the version of a given operator
- **tasks**: A map of tasks that can be run. These are the atomic runnable unit of a KUDO operator, and are made up of a series of YAML manifests. These are defined more in detail in [Tasks](#tasks).
- **plans**: A map of plans that can be run. These are the core partitioning unit of a KUDO operator. A plan is intended to run a single "operations task" for a operator, such as backup, restore, deployment, or update. This is defined in detail in [Plans](#plans)

This file undergoes a Go template pass on Instance instantiation before being parsed. This is described more in detail in [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases)

#### params.yaml

The `params.yaml` file is a struct that defines parameters for operator. This can articulate descriptions, defaults, and triggers, etc. In the MySQL example, this looks like:

```yaml
backupFile:
  description: "The name of the backup file"
  default: backup.sql
password:
  default: password
  description: "Password for the mysql instance"
  trigger: deploy
```

These values are meant to be overridden by Instance resources when instantiating a operator.

This file undergoes a Go template pass on Instance instantiation before being parsed. This is described more in detail in [Parameters](#parameters).

#### common/

The common directory contains YAML manifests for all instances of the operator to leverage. The requirement/scope of these objects is defined in [KEP 0005](0005-cluster-resources-for-crds.md)

#### templates/

The templates directory contains YAML manifests for operator tasks to use. These are described in more detail in [Templates](#templates-1).

Each template undergoes a Go template pass for an Instance when it's corresponding Task is run.

### Plans

Plans are the core unit of operation within a KUDO operator. Each KUDO plan represents an individual unit of operations work. This may include backups, restores, deployments, upgrades, compaction, or any other myriad of operations that an application operator may want to perform with KUDO.

A single plan is composed of [steps](#steps) and a step is composed of [tasks](#tasks). Individual steps are executed sequentially by default while the tasks within the step are executed in parallel.

### Steps

Steps are used for fine grained partition within a plan. Steps are represented as a list of objects that define the step name and a list of tasks to be run during that step.

All tasks within the same step are applied at the same time. For runnable templates within a task (such as a Deployment, StatefulSet, Pod, etc), parallelism of workloads should be controlled through other Kubernetes primitives such as PodDisruptionBudget, and added to the task where the relevant workload is run.

If a step contains a runnable task that has readiness probes defined, the step waits until the readiness probe succeeds before moving onto the next step.

### Tasks

Tasks are a map of task name to a list of templates that should be executed in that step. With [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases), tasks can be represented in multiple forms, as long as the end result is a ready-to-run YAML manifest for a Kubernetes object.

#### Files

If a filename is specified, KUDO will execute a Go Template on the relevant filename, described more in detail in [Templates](#templates-1).

#### Resources vs. Patches

KUDO additionally supports Kustomize for defining resources and patching for tasks. Kustomize is applied after any Go templating steps. This is useful for defining common bases for objects, or for extending operators as described in [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases).

#### Task Application

Once KUDO has assembled a full set of templates for a task, they will be applied using Kubernetes server-side apply at the same time.

### Parameters

Parameters are a map of Parameter structs, with the key being the name of the parameter. A default value can be set inside of a parameter, as well as a description. When no default is specified, the value is required. If an Instance is created without a required parameter, it will have an Error event added to it describing the validation failure. As described in [Execution State](#execution-state), they are wrapped into the `.Params` object for use by all templated objects. All keys, even arbitrary keys unused by KUDO, are wrapped into the `.Params` object for potential use by other templates.

Parameters are intentionally open for extension for adding fields in the future for validation and more.

### Templates

A template is a standard Kubernetes manifest which **MAY** have additional Go Templating. These Go Templates include [Sprig](https://github.com/masterminds/sprig) to provide a standard library of functions familiar to Helm users. Additional values are available and are described in [Execution State](#execution-state).

## Future Work

### Allow for other templating engines

It may the be case that a operator developer does not want to, or cannot leverage the current templating system, either because functionality is not present in the language, or the operator may need to query external systems for value injection. We may want to extend our supported templating system to include other rendering laguages (e.g. [cue](https://github.com/cuelang/cue)), or allow a operator to deploy their own rendering engine in the Kubernetes cluster and expose a well defined interface (e.g. defined with Swagger) to KUDO for send rendering requests.

The specifications of what this API needs to be is out of scope of this KEP.
