## Summary

Drive KUDO to have a set of tools and specifications for creating frameworks.

## Motivation

KUDO provides a way to reduce the amount of code necessary for the creation of an framework for Kubernetes. The current implementation of KUDO requires a significant amount of YAML to define an framework, located in one file. This YAML relies in nested YAML inlined via multiline strings, is not extensible, and is prone to error. This KEP defines an framework SDK that solves these issues.

## Goals

The toolkit must provide the ability for:

- conditional inclusions
- defining default values
- replacement of values
- removal of keys and values

## Proposal

A KUDO framework is split into several base components, ordered from the outside-in:

- [Plans](#plans)
- [Steps](#steps)
- [Tasks](#tasks)
- [Templates](#templates)
- [Parameters](#parameters)
- [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases)
- [Execution State](#execution-state)

These combine to form an framework responsible for the deployment, upgrading, and day 2 operations of software deployed on Kubernetes. While KUDO ships with a templating system, it is not intended to advance the state of deploying software on Kubernetes, and provides facilities for integrating with other templating and deployment systems. KUDO's focus is instead on the sequencing and day 2 operations of this software, and is able to take advantage of existing templating to fulfill this need.

### Definitions

### Framework Organization

An framework bundle is a folder that contains all of the manifests needed to create or extend a KUDO framework. In the most basic form, an framework bundle is structured in the following format:

```shell
.
├── framework.yaml
├── params.yaml
└── common
    └── common.yaml
└── templates
    ├── backup.yaml
    ├── clear-data.yaml
    ├── deployment.yaml
    ├── init.yaml
    ├── load-data.yaml
    ├── pvc.yaml
    ├── restore.yaml
    └── service.yaml
```

#### framework.yaml

`framework.yaml` is the base definition of an framework. It follows the following format, extracted from the MySQL example:

```yaml
name: "my-framework"
description: A test example framework.
version: "5.7"
kudoVersion: ">= 0.2.0"
kubeVersion: ">= 1.14"
maintainers:
  - Bob <bob@example.com>
  - Alice <alice@example.com>
url: https://github.com/myframework/myframework
tasks:
  deploy:
    resources:
      - pvc.yaml
      - deployment.yaml
      - service.yaml
      - deployment2.yaml
      - job.yaml
    patches:
      - deploy-patch.yaml
    patchesStrategicMerge:
      - super-weird-deploy-patch.yaml
  init:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
  pv:
    resources:
      - pvc.yaml
  backup:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - backup.yaml
  restore:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - restore.yaml
  load-data:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - load-data.yaml
  clear-data:
    resources:
      - init.yaml
    patches:
      - clear-data.yaml
  query:
    resources:
      - job.yaml
plans:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - name: deploy
        tasks:
          - deploy
      - name: init
        tasks:
          - init
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - init
        delete: true
  backup:
    steps:
      - name: pv
        tasks:
          - pv
      - name: backup
        tasks:
          - backup
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - backup
        delete: true
  restore:
    steps:
      - name: restore
        tasks:
          - restore
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - restore
        delete: true
```

While subsequent sections go into deeper detail, the top level keys of the framework are:

- **version**: String defining the version of a given framework
- **tasks**: A map of tasks that can be run. These are the atomic runnable unit of a KUDO framework, and are made up of a series of YAML manifests. These are defined more in detail in [Tasks](#tasks).
- **plans**: A map of plans that can be run. These are the core partitioning unit of a KUDO framework. A plan is intended to run a single "operations task" for an framework, such as backup, restore, deployment, or update. This is defined in detail in [Plans](#plans)

This file undergoes a Go template pass on Instance instantiation before being parsed. This is described more in detail in [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases)

#### params.yaml

The `params.yaml` file is a struct that defines parameters for framework. This can articulate descriptions, defaults, and triggers etc., In the MySQL example, this looks like:

```yaml
backupFile:
  description: "The name of the backup file"
  default: backup.sql
password:
  default: password
  description: "Password for the mysql instance"
  trigger: deploy
```

These values are meant to be overridden by Instance resources when instantiating an framework.

This file undergoes a Go template pass on Instance instantiation before being parsed. This is described more in detail in [Parameters](#parameters).

#### common/

The common directory contains 0-to-many YAML manifests for all instances of the framework to leverage. The requirement/scope of these objects is defined in [KEP 0005](0005-cluster-resources-for-crds.md)

#### templates/

The templates directory contains 0-to-many YAML manifests for framework tasks to use. These are described in more detail in [Templates](#templates).

Each template undergoes a Go template pass for an Instance when it's corresponding Task is run.

### Plans

Plans are the core unit of operation within a KUDO framework. Each KUDO plan represents an individual unit of operations work. This may include backups, restores, deployments, upgrades, compaction, or any other myriad of operations that an application operator may want to perform with KUDO.

A single plan is composed of [Steps](#steps) and a step is composed of [tasks](#tasks). Individual steps are executed sequentially by default while the tasks within the step are executed in parallel.

### Steps

Steps are used for fine grained partition within a plan. Steps are represented as a list of objects that define the step name and a list of tasks to be run during that step.

All tasks within the same step are applied at the same time. For runnable templates within a task (such as a Deployment, StatefulSet, Pod, etc), parallelism of workloads should be controlled through other Kubernetes primitives such as PodDisruptionBudget, and added to the task where the relevant workload is run.

If a step contains a runnable task that has readiness probes defined, the step waits until the readiness probe succeeds before moving onto the next step.

### Tasks

Tasks are a map of task name to a list of templates that should be executed in that step. With [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases), tasks can be represented in multiple forms, as long as the end result is a ready-to-run YAML manifest for a Kubernetes object.

#### Files

If a filename is specified, KUDO will execute a Go Template on the relevant filename, described more in detail in [Templates](#templates).

#### Resources vs. Patches

KUDO additionally supports Kustomize for defining resources and patching for tasks. Kustomize is applied after any Go templating steps. This is useful for defining common bases for objects, or for extending frameworks as described in [Extensions and Bases](#extensions-and-bases).

#### Task Application

Once KUDO has assembled a full set of templates for a task, they will be applied using Kubernetes server-side apply at the same time.

### Parameters

Parameters are a map of Parameter structs, with the key being the name of the parameter. A default value can be set inside of a parameter, as well as a description. When no default is specified, the value is required. If an Instance is created without a required parameter, it will have an Error event added to it describing the validation failure. As described in [Execution State](#execution-state), they are wrapped into the `.Params` object for use by all templated objects. All keys, even arbitrary keys unused by KUDO, are wrapped into the `.Params` object for potential use by other templates.

Parameters are intentionally open for extension for adding fields in the future for validation and more.

### Templates

A template is a standard Kubernetes manifest which **MAY** have additional Go Templating. These Go Templates include [Sprig](https://github.com/masterminds/sprig) to provide a standard library of functions familiar to Helm users. Additional values are available and are described in [Execution State](#execution-state).

## Extensions and Bases

Extensions and bases describe a mechanism for building frameworks or extensions to frameworks from a given base. As an example, a base can be an framework, a Helm chart, a CNAB bundle, or any future format that describes the deployment of a set of resources.

In this document, an **extension** is any KUDO framework that extends from some base. A **base** is the complete set of manifests, metadata, and other files provided by that base's type. A base should provide complete information that users of that base tool are expected to have. The base types and what they expose to charts that extend from them are described in their respective sub-sections.

To support extending from a base, `framework.yaml` is extended to support the `extends` keyword:

```yaml
extends:
  kudo:
    framework: "mysql"
    version: "5.7"
```

After extending, the base resources are inherited by the extending framework. The behavior of extensions and values available from the base are described in their corresponding sub-section.

When a task is defined in an extended framework, it **replaces** the task from the base. The tasks available are dependent on the base type and are described more in detail in their corresponding sub-section.

When a plan is defined in an extended framework, it **replaces** the plan from the base. The plans available are dependent on the base type and are described more in detail in their corresponding sub-section.

### Task Extensions

- `task.from`: The `from` directive inside of a named task copies over all resources and patches from the base task of the same name. Resources and patches that overlap with base resource and patch names replace resource and patches already defined by the base. If the base task doesn't exist, an error event will be added to the Instance that is attempting to use this FrameworkVersion.
- `base/`: The `base/` directive in a template reference resolves to the named template within the extended base. For example, `base/deployment.yaml` corresponds to `deployment.yaml` file located within the base referenced by `extends`. This enables base templates to be used directly in new plans defined by the extending framework.

### Plan Extensions

- `plan.from`: The `from` directive inside of a named plan copies over the steps for that plan. Any additional steps defined are **appended** to the base plan.
- `base/`: The `base/` directive in a task reference resolves to the named task within the extended base. For example, `base/deploy` corresponds to the `deploy` task in the base. This enables fine grained control over replacing steps in a base plan.

### Example Framework Extension

This framework is built from the MySQL framework defined above, but adds custom plans that allow for the loading and clearing of data that is required for a particular business application

```shell
.
├── framework.yaml
├── params.yaml
└── templates
    ├── clear-data.yaml
    ├── load-data.yaml
```

Since this framework extends `mysql/5.7`, it inherits the plans defined in the base framework, so `backup` and `restore` plans can be run without any configuration in this extension framework.

#### framework.yaml

`framework.yaml` is the base definition of an framework. It follows the following format, extracted from the MySQL example:

```yaml
extends:
  kudo:
    framework: "mysql"
    version: "5.7"
version: "5.7"
tasks:
  load-data:
    resources:
      - base/init.yaml
    patches:
      - load-data.yaml
  clear-data:
    from: base/init
    patches:
      - clear-data.yaml
plans:
  load:
    steps:
      - name: load
        tasks:
          - load-data
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - load-data
        delete: true
  clear:
    steps:
      - name: clear
        tasks:
          - clear-data
      - name: cleanup
        tasks:
          - clear-data
        delete: true
```

Tasks `load-data` and `clear-data` essentially look the same, but `load-data` is built fresh, and references the base template object, whereas the `clear-data` task extends the `base/init` task with an additional patch.

#### params.yaml

This framework also provides a new parameter that can be used to specify unique datasources to load

```yaml
data-location:
  default: https://s3.aws.com/bucket/data.sql
  description: "Location of data to load into database"
  trigger: load
```

And can be used in `templates/clear-data.yaml` and `templates/load-data.yaml`

### KUDO

### Helm

## Execution State

## Example Framework

## Future Work

### Allow for other templating engines

It may the be case that an framework developer does not want to, or cannot leverage the current templating system, either because functionality is not present in the language, or the framework may need to query external systems for value injection. We may want to extend our supported templating system to include other rendering laguages (e.g. [cue](https://github.com/cuelang/cue)), or allow an framework to deploy their own rendering engine in the Kubernetes cluster and expose a well defined interface (e.g. defined with Swagger) to KUDO for send rendering requests.

The specifications of what this API needs to be is out of scope of this KEP.
