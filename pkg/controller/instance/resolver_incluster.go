// InClusterResolver is a server-side package resolver for packages that are already installed in the cluster. It is a simpler
// version of the client-side pkg/kudoctl/packages/resolver/resolver_incluster.go. The client-side version would search
// the installed OperatorVersions and try to resolve any valid combination of the operator name and its app and operator versions,
// same as we would search in the repository.
// This resolver is only used to make sure that all the dependencies of an operator exist and that referenced operator versions
// are installed and uniquely identifiable by the passed operator name, appVersion and operatorVersion parameters
// (see pkg/apis/kudo/v1beta1/operatorversion_types_helpers.go::OperatorVersionName method).
