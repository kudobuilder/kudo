# Style Guide

In an effort to encourage clear, clean, uniform and readable code it is useful to have a style guide to establish standards and expectations for code and artifact files.

KUDO is a [Kubernetes (K8S)](https://kubernetes.io/) project written primarily in [Go](https://golang.org/), both of which have some differences in their style and expectation of code and APIs. In addition the founders of KUDO have some of their own preferences. This guide captures the preferred standards of this project.

## Golang

When writing Go code, We favor Go idioms over Kubernetes style. Worth reading:

Here are some common cases / deviations:

### Lint and Code Checks

All code should pass the linter. For cases of intentional lint deviation, it is expected that:

* The linter is configured with the new rule.
* The linter is configured to ignore the case.
* The case is documented in code.

`make lint`

### import

The general Go approach is to have a line of separation between Go libraries and external packages. We prefer to have an additional line of separation grouping kudo packages separately at the end. Example:

```
import (
	// standard library packages
	"context"
	"fmt"

	// third-party library packages
	"github.com/onsi/gomega"
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	appsv1 "k8s.io/api/apps/v1"
	"k8s.io/client-go/tools/record"
	"sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/k8sdeps/kunstruct"
	"sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/pkg/target"
	ktypes "sigs.k8s.io/kustomize/pkg/types"

	// kudo packages
	"github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/pkg/util/kudo"
	"github.com/kudobuilder/kudo/pkg/version"
)
```

Executing `make lint` uses `goimports` which is configured to ensure this structure and will error in most situations that differ.  Unfortunately not all pattern mismatches are captured.

`make imports` is also a useful tool in order to help create this structure.  If all imports are in 1 import block (no lines of separation), `make imports` will modify the file in the appropriate order and structure.


### Naming

In general, naming should follow [Go conventions](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#names) over [Kubernetes code conventions](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/coding-conventions.md#code-conventions).
