# This test verifies that the InstanceController triggers an execution of the
# "upgrade" plan when an instance is upgraded.
#
# In order to do so, it creates a simple operator, its corresponding
# operator version, and an instance.
#
# The next step will then create new OperatorVersion which will include an
# "upgrade" plan, update the instance, and finally verify that the right
# PlanExecution was created.
