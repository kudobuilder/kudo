# This test verifies that when an instance is upgraded, the InstanceController
# triggers an execution of the "update" plan when the new version does not
# include an "upgrade" plan.
#
# In order to do so, it creates a simple operator, its corresponding
# operator version (without an "upgrade" plan), and an instance.
#
# The next step will then create new OperatorVersion which will include
# "update" and "deploy" plans, update the instance, and finally verify that the
# right PlanExecution was created.
