# This test verifies that when an instance is upgraded, the InstanceController
# triggers an execution of the "deploy" plan when the new version includes
# neither an "upgrade" nor an "update" plan.
#
# In order to do so, it creates a simple operator, its corresponding operator
# version (with only a "deploy" plan), and an instance.
#
# The next step will:
#
#   1. Remove the "deploy" plan execution created for the original version of
#      the instance.
#   2. Create a new operator version with just a "deploy" plan.
#   3. Trigger an upgrading by updating the operator version used by the instance.
#   4. Verify that KUDO creates a new "deploy" plan execution.
