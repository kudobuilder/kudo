# CLI Usage

This document demonstrates how to use the CLI but also shows what happens in `KUDO` under the hood, which can be helpful when troubleshooting.

## Kubectl KUDO Plugin

### Requirements

| `kubectl kudo plan history <name> [flags]` | View all available plans. |

### Flags

```
Usage:
  kubectl-kudo install <name> [flags]

Flags:
      --all-dependencies          Installs all dependency packages. (default "false")
      --auto-approve              Skip interactive approval when existing version found. (default "false")

| `GIT_PASSWORD` | Set a GitHub password to connect via the GitHub API with | 

### Examples

#### Install a Package

There are two options installing a package. While `kubectl apply -f *.yaml` is encouraged when developing and
having `framework.yaml`, `frameworkversion.yaml` and `instance.yaml` locally present, it is recommended to use the 
official packages provided through the [kubebuilder/frameworks](https://github.com/kudobuilder/frameworks) repo. 
The `KUDO` plugin for `kubectl` offers a convenient way of installing those files via command line.

##### Install just the KUDO Package without Dependencies

This is the default behavior and just installs the according package.

```bash
$ kubectl kudo install kafka
framework.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/kafka created
frameworkversion.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/kafka-2.11-2.4.0 created
```

#### Install a KUDO Package with Dependencies

Sometimes you want to automatically install all dependencies a package comes with. This behavior is controlled via
the flag `--all-dependencies`, and if set installs all dependencies a package has as well.

```bash
$ kubectl kudo install kafka --all-dependencies
framework.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/kafka created
frameworkversion.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/kafka-2.11-2.4.0 created
framework.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/zookeeper created
frameworkversion.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/zookeeper-1.0 created
```

#### Install a Package with InstanceName & Parameters

Use `--instance` and `--parameter`/`-p` for setting an Instance name or Parameter:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo install kafka --instance=my-kafka-name --parameter="KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_URI,zk-zk-0.zk-hs:2181,zk-zk-1.zk-hs:2181,zk-zk-2.zk-hs:2181" --parameter="KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_PATH,/small" -p="BROKERS_COUNTER,3"
framework.kudo.k8s.io/kafka unchanged
frameworkversion.kudo.k8s.io/kafka unchanged
No Instance tied to this "kafka" version has been found. Do you want to create one? (Yes/no) 
instance.kudo.k8s.io/v1alpha1/my-kafka-name created
$ kubectl get instances
NAME            AGE
my-kafka-name   6s
```

#### List Instances

In order to inspect instances deployed by `KUDO` we need to get an overview of all instances running.
Therefor we use the `list` command which has subcommands to show all available instances:

`kubectl kudo list instances --namespace=<default> --kubeconfig=<$HOME/.kube/config>`

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo list instances
  List of current instances in namespace "default":
  .
  ├── small
  ├── up
  └── zk
```

This maps to the `kubectl` command: 

`kubectl get instances`

Example:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo instances
  NAME      CREATED AT
  small     4d
  up        3d
  zk        4d
```

#### Get the Status of an Instance

(Or how to look up your instance status)

Now that we know the available instances we can get the current status of all plans to an particular instance. The command for this is:

`kubectl kudo plan status --instance=<instanceName> --kubeconfig=<$HOME/.kube/config>`

*Note: The `--instance` flag is mandatory and **not optional**.*

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan status --instance=up
  Plan(s) for "up" in namespace "default":
  .
  └── up (Framework-Version: "upgrade-v1" Active-Plan: "up-deploy-493146000")
      ├── Plan deploy (serial strategy) [COMPLETE]
      │   └── Phase par (serial strategy) [COMPLETE]
      │       └── Step run-step (COMPLETE)
      ├── Plan update (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
      │   └── Phase par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
      │       └── Step par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
      │           └── run-step [NOT ACTIVE]
      └── Plan upgrade (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
          └── Phase par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
              └── Step par (serial strategy) [NOT ACTIVE]
                  └── run-step [NOT ACTIVE]
```

In this tree chart we see all important information in one screen:

* `up` is the current instance we are looking at.
* `default` is the current namespace we are in.
* `upgrade-v1` is the current **Framework-Version**.
* `up-deploy-493146000` is the current **Active-Plan**.
    + `par` is a serial phase within the `deploy` plan that has been `COMPLETE`
    + `deploy` is a `serial` plan that has been `COMPLETE`.
    + `run-step` is a `serial` step that has been `COMPLETE`.
* `update` is another `serial` plan that is currently `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `par` is a serial phase within the `update` plan that has been `NOT ACTIVE`
    + `par` is a `serial` collection of steps that has been `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `run-step` is a `serial` step within the `par` step collection that has been `NOT ACTIVE`.
* `upgrade` is another `serial` plan that is currently `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `par` is a serial phase within the `upgrade` plan that has been `NOT ACTIVE`
    + `par` is a `serial` collection of steps that has been `NOT ACTIVE`.
    + `run-step` is a `serial` step within the `par` step collection that has been `NOT ACTIVE`.
    
This would translate to the following manual `kubectl` commands:

* `kubectl get instances` (to get the matching `FrameworkVersion`)
* `kubectl describe frameworkversion upgrade-v1` (to get the current `PlanExecution`)
* `kubectl describe planexecution up-deploy-493146000` (to get the status of the `Active-Plan`)

The overall overview of all available plans can be found in `Spec.Plans` of the matching `FrameworkVersion`.

When looking at the particular `PlanExecution` we are able to see the status of the current applied plan.

```bash
$ kubectl describe planexecution up-deploy-493146000
  Name:         up-deploy-493146000
  Namespace:    default

The status information for the `Active-Plan` is nested in this part:

```bash
  Status:
    Name:  deploy
    Phases:
      Name:   par
      State:  COMPLETE
      Steps:
        Name:    run-step
        State:   COMPLETE
      Strategy:  serial
    State:       COMPLETE
    Strategy:    serial
```

Our tree view makes this information more readable to the user and creates a better user experience through one command rather than picking from multiple responses the bits and pieces.

#### Get the History to PlanExecutions

This is helpful if you want to find out which plan ran on your instance to a particular `FrameworkVersion`.
Let's say you want to know all plans that ran for the instance `up` and its FrameworkVersion `upgrade-v1`:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan history upgrade-v1 --instance=up
  History of plan-executions for "up" in namespace "default" to framework-version "upgrade-v1":
  .
  └── up-deploy-493146000 (created 4h56m12s ago)
```

If you want to have a broader history to all plans applied to an instance:

```bash
$ kubectl kudo plan history --instance=up
  History of all plan-executions for "up" in namespace "default":
  .
  └── up-deploy-493146000 (created 4h52m34s ago)
```

This includes the previous history but also all FrameworkVersions that have been applied to the selected instance.
